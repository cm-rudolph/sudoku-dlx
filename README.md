# A sudoku solver that uses Algorithm DLX

This project is an example Java application, that solves [sudokus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) using Algorithm
DLX. To do so efficiently, it uses a library, which can be found [at GitHub](https://github.com/cm-rudolph/dlx).

The application can be started using the bundled gradle wrapper:

```shell
./gradlew run
```

It solves one 16x16 and 50,000 9x9 sample sudokus.
